IMGEN_CACHE_IMAGES="Set to yes if you wish IMGEN to cache resized images (recommended)"
IMGEN_CACHE_TIME="Amount of time to cache images in minutes"
IMGEN_HTTP_IMAGES="Allow external images accessed through http? The default is 'no', if you change to 'yes' you will be able to access your images hosted on another domain, but may need to change your PHP configuration to turn on allow_url_fopen. Images hosted on your own Joomla site can be accessed regardless of this setting."
IMGEN_DEFAULTWIDTH="Default width for your images. If you want to set a default size for your images then use this and the default height parameter. You will still be able to override this value by passing it in the url"

IMGEN_HELLO_ADMIN="<p>Hello, this is the admin area for IMGEN. Click on the options button above to set the main options for IMGEN. There is not much that you need to do set up. You can access your images (if they are in the default images folder) using the url:-</p><p>index.php?option=com_imgen&img=mypicture.jpg&amp;width=300&height=200&format=image</p><p>If you have a default width and height set up you can shorten this to:-</p><p>index.php?option=com_imgen&amp;img=mypicture.jpg&format=image</p><p>You can find further information about using com imgen <a href='http://www.spiralscripts.co.uk/Documentation/imgen-image-generator-documentation.html'>here</a>.</p>"
IMGEN_DEFAULTQUALITY="Default image quality. Ranges 0 (worst quality) to 100 (best). Raising the quality reduces image compression but increases file size. The value set here can be overridden in the URL"
IMGEN_DISPLAYERRORS="Display Errors when outputting image. Set to yes for debugging." 
IMGEN_CACHECOMPLETEPATH="Preserve the folder structure when caching images. Eg if your original image is in folder images/stories/news/, the cached image will be in images/imgen/images/stories/news. Usually you don't need this, but if you are having problems with image naming conflicts you can enable this feature."
